# About
Generalized setup scripts for my development use. Also will contain some notes as I feel like adding them.

I have excluded some details due to the repo being public.

## archenvscript.sh
This is for Arch Linux development environment.
I created this script to document the setup of a new linux environment for a ruby project I work on.

It contains the commands for installing java, mongodb, regis, elasticsearch, rvm

It also installs the latest ruby with rvm and installs the bundler gem.
