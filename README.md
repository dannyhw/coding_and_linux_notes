# About
Generalized setup scripts for my development use.

I have excluded some details due to the repo being public.

## archenvscript.sh
I created this script to document the setup for a ruby project I work on.

It contains the commands for installing java, mongodb, regis, elasticsearch, rvm

It also installs the latest ruby with rvm and installs the bundler gem.
